# Thunderdome
The most boring game ever made.

## Installation
Thunderdome requires Rust to be installed and for `cargo` to be available on the system `PATH`. (See rust-lang.org)[https://www.rust-lang.org]

## How to play
Run `cargo run` from the project root directory. Bust a deal, face the wheel!
